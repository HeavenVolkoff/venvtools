# venvtools

A simple setuptools command to help with virtualenv

# DEPRECATED

Use either [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) or [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) according to your use case.

### Motivation

The objective of this utility is to provide means for easy creation of a virtual
environment for local packages using python's standard venv module and to integrate
with setuptools distribution model for seamless resolution and installation of
dependencies.

### How to use

Inside your package root folder execute the following to create the venv and install
your package dependencies inside it:
```shell
python ./setup.py venv
```
or (if your `setup.py` is executable)
```shell
./setup.py venv
```

> Currently updating dependencies inside the venv is not working correctly.
> It's recommended to recreate the venv to archive it.
>
> (This will be fixed in a posterior version)
```shell
./setup.py venv --rm && ./setup.py venv
```
